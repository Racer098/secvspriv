                            <p class="mb-0"><br>Security can be simply defined as how you protect yourself and your data. Do you have a password on your phone? Do you encrypt your hard drives? Do you use an antivirus? Well these are all important security measures that keep your personal data safe and out of hands of people who shouldn’t have it.Privacy, on the other hand, is any information that can be tied to your personal identity. Just because something is secure, doesn’t mean that people can’t collect any of your personal information.<br><br></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Antivirus</h2>
                    <p><br>Antiviruses are one of the most widely debated topics for Windows PC users. Some people say Windows Defender is enough, some say you don’t need anything, some say to invest in a paid service, and some say to use as many paid services as you can (don’t do that one). Antiviruses protect you from malicious files and programs, they let you scan your computer for threats and vulnerabilities, and paid options typically give you even more security features, like web-plugins, which keep you off malicious sites, password managers, ad blocking software, you guys get the point. Your security has dramatically improved because of this software.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/istockphoto-1249572084-170667a.jpg">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>But, privacy has gone down the drain. You’re putting your trust in a third-party company to scan the contents of every file you download to your computer, every program you open, and a lot of this data is sent to Antivirus companies to “Improve their service and detection.” In reality, we don’t know what they’re doing with that data. They could very well be selling it to third parties who are using this data to influence an election. AVG, an antivirus company, actually came under a lot of fire for a very intrusive privacy policy.<br><br></p>
                    <p>That’s the antivirus example, it typically helps people understand the difference between security and privacy pretty well. It’s very important to fully distinguish these two terms, because they represent two completely different goals and ideas, that are difficult to simultaneously achieve.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
